🧑‍🍳 Smart Recipe GeneratorThis project is a full-stack web application designed for a technical assessment. It suggests recipes based on available ingredients provided by the user, incorporating filtering, scoring, and personalized recommendation logic.🔗 Live Application & Repository StructureComponentStatusURLLive Frontend (Vercel)Deployed[Insert your Vercel Application URL here]Live Backend API (Render)Deployed[Insert your Render API URL here]GitHub RepositoryFinal Codehttps://github.com/susa0676/SmartRecipeGeneratorRepository StructureSmartRecipeGenerator/

✨ Project Features & Requirements MetCategoryRequirementImplementation StatusUser InputText input or selecting from a listSatisfied: Implemented visual, image-based selection and a blended text input field.Core LogicRecipe matching algorithmSatisfied: Implemented a Weighted Coverage Scoring system in the backend.Core LogicSubstitution suggestionsSatisfied: Missing ingredients are identified, and substitutions are pulled from the database and displayed.Data/FiltersDietary restrictions handlingSatisfied: Filtering by Vegetarian and Gluten-Free is enforced via API query.Data/FeaturesMinimum 20 recipes; detailed nutritional infoSatisfied: Database contains 23 recipes with full nutritional and serving size data.User FeedbackAllow users to rate and save their favorite recipesSatisfied: Implemented separate API endpoints (/favorite and /rate) for persistence.User FeedbackProvide a "recipe suggestions" featureSatisfied: Implemented a Content-Based Recommendation engine that suggests recipes based on the cuisine of saved favorites.UI/UXClean, intuitive, and mobile-responsive designSatisfied: Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS using a modern Blue/Teal color theme.🛠️ Technical Approach & Logic1. Technology StackFrontend: Next.js (App Router) + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (for styling and responsiveness).Backend (API): Python + FastAPI + Uvicorn (Asynchronous).Database: MongoDB Atlas (Free Tier).Hosting: Vercel (Frontend) and Render (Backend).2. Recipe Matching and ScoringThe backend's core matching logic is executed in the POST /api/recipes/search endpoint:Filtering: Recipes are initially filtered by exact matches on isVegetarian, isGlutenFree, and max_cooking_time.Scoring (Recipe Matching Logic): The system calculates a weighted score for each resulting recipe:$$\text{Score} = (0.8 \times \text{Ingredient Coverage}) + (0.2 \times \text{Average Rating})$$Prioritization: Results are sorted and displayed based on this score, ensuring the recipes the user can most completely make are shown first.3. State Persistence and Multi-User ArchitectureTo meet the user feedback requirement, the system uses a simulated multi-user architecture:Persistence: A unique, hardcoded CURRENT_USER_ID ("demoUser4") is defined on the frontend. All save and rate actions pass this ID to the backend.History: The backend stores user data (favorites and embedded ratings in the recipes collection) segmented by this ID, ensuring user history is maintained across refreshes.Suggestions: The /api/user/{user_id}/suggestions endpoint analyzes the user’s favorite cuisines and suggests new, highly-rated recipes matching those preferences, providing the dynamic update.⚙️ Setup and Deployment InstructionsLocal SetupClone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/susa0676/SmartRecipeGenerator
Database: Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster is running, and the SmartRecipeDB database is populated with the 23 recipes.Backend (FastAPI):Bashcd smart-recipe-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Create .env file with your connection string: MONGO_URI="..."
uvicorn main:app --reload
Frontend (Next.js):Bashcd ../smart-recipe-frontend
npm install
# Create .env.local with your backend's local URL: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
npm run dev
Production Deployment NotesThe Render deployment used the PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.8 environment variable to ensure compatibility and resolve the pydantic-core native compilation error.The Vercel deployment uses the live Render URL for the NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL environment variable.
